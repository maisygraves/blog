Most portfolios treat professional history as a linear timeline of static entries. I've taken a difference approach: treating my body of work as an **evolving network of competencies**.

By framing my professional development as a data engineering challenge, I designed a queryable portfolio engine that transforms traditional project logs into a dynamic knowledge graph.

## 1. the vision: relational professional development

My objective is to transition from simple "flat file" tagging to a **relational understanding** of expertise. In this system, every post is a data input that adheres to a strict schema, ensuring the portfolio is analytics-ready and structurally sound.

## 2. architecture and roadmap

The system follows an interactive deployment strategy, evolving from static markdown files to a robust, relational backend.

### stage one: static ingestion (current)

* **pipeline:** Markdown (YAML front matter) --> Jekyll + Liquid --> GitHub Pages.
* **status:** Active. Focuses on scheme enforcement within YAML.

### stage two: local ETL pipeline

* **pipeline:** Python Script --> PostgreSQL (local instance).
* **focus:** Extracting front matter metadata to audit skill density and tool frequency.

### stage three: the relational engine (target state)

* **pipeline:** PostgreSQL DB --> Python Logic --> Markdown Generator --> GitHub Pages.
* **focus:** Decoupling content from metadata, allowing the database to serve as the single source of truth.

## data schema and relational logic

To support complex queries such as *"Identify all projects utilizing Python where SQL was not the primary data store"*, the architecture utilizes a normalized, many-to-many design.

### the data contract

| Entity || Type || Requirement |
| :--- |:---| :--- |:---| :--- |
| **Posts** || Node || Must be categorized as 'project' or 'note' |
| **Skills** || Attribute    || Mapped to the Grolemund/Wickham framework |
| **Tools** || Attribute || Unique instances (PostgreSQL, Python) |
| **Resources** || Reference || Curated citations and doc links |

### relational mapping

* **junction tables:** 'Post_Skills' and 'Post_Tools' tables enable the networked structure.
* **normalization:** Skills and Tools exist as unique entities to prevent "tag bloat" and ensure data integrity across the graph.

## system requirements

### functional

* **schema enforcement:** Automated validation of YAML front matter to prevent broken nodes.
* **bi-directional discovery:** Interactive filtering where selecting a tool surfaces all related projects and theoretical notes.
* **recruiter view:** High-level filtering for specific competencies (e.g. "data wrangling" vs "exploratory data analysis")

### non-functional

* **data integrity:** Implementation of GIGO (gargbage in - garbage out) prevention via Liquid template logic. 
* **modular portability:** The architecture allows for a backend migration from Markdown to SQL without requiring a rewrite of the core content.
* **proof of concept:** The portfolio itself serves as a live demonstration of ETL logic, database normalization and knowledge management.
